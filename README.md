# Marlin for Anycubic Mega Zero with BTT SKR Mini MZ

This is my working build of Marlin based on the latest bugfix branch per late january. Only change from the default configuration is getting my BLTouch clone to work. The Z-endstop is now configured to be the BLTouch clone.

I'm using this for mounting the BLTouch: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4588250
